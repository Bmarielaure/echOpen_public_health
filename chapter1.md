Clinical research it's one of the future challenge of echopen project \(ideally : 2018\). Two foundations could financially support it. Sanofi's foundation would like to be associated with a maternal health study. This could be possible in Madagascar, in association with pasteur institute. Jacques Fabre foundation want to be associate with future essay too, but the subject isn't already stopped.

Method of the future essay : we need to choose between

* echOpen versus gold standard
* inclusion of echOpen probe in a bigger study. 

We have to choose the professional population we have to focus on \(medical practitioners, midwifes...\). The educational aspects have to been debate too !
